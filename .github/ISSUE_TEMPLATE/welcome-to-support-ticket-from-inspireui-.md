_* Step 1 (require): describe detail issues & screenshots *_
+ Detail Issues: 
+ Product & version:
+ Flutter (or React Native) version: 
+ Testing Device/Simulator: 
+ Screenshot issues (drag the file to attach here): 


_* Step 2 (require): verify proof of purchasing the license by submitting this form http://verify.inspireui.com *_



*Important Note:* 
- We will close the ticket if missing the proof of purchase on step 2. The screenshot purchase attaches here will be invalid.
- Kindly create only *One Ticket* & includes all the issues, that would help us focus to resolve it better. 
- If your all ticket was resolved & closed, but want to create a new ticket, just do simple step by linking to the previous verified ID (you don't need to submit the form again), for example, #Ticket-ID

Thank you so much for your time ðŸ˜Š
